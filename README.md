# React useEffect Hook Error: Missing Return and Incorrect Conditional Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: missing return statement for cleanup and incorrect conditional rendering logic.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` to log a message when `count` is greater than 0. However, it has two issues:

1. **Missing Return Statement:**  The `useEffect` hook is missing a return statement, which is crucial for cleanup. This can lead to memory leaks if the component unmounts before the effect's cleanup actions are executed. 
2. **Incorrect Conditional Rendering:** The conditional rendering (`if (count > 0)`) is placed directly inside the `useEffect`. This may not always give the expected behavior because `useEffect` runs after each render. Placing such logic inside `useEffect` can be unnecessary and even problematic depending on the application's behavior. Instead it's better to move the logic to the render section of the component.

## Bug Solution

The corrected code includes a return function in the useEffect to handle cleanup tasks, ensuring proper resource management. The conditional logic is moved to a more appropriate section in the render method, thereby improving the component's behavior.
